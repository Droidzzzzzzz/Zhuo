    <h1>Hello World: Why I Built This Site</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">February 27, 2026 &middot; 3 min read</p>

    <div class="post-content">
      <p>Every developer needs a home on the internet. Not a profile page on someone else's platform — a real, honest-to-goodness website that you own and control. This is mine.</p>

      <h2>Why plain HTML and CSS?</h2>
      <p>In a world of React, Next.js, Astro, Hugo, and a hundred other tools, I went with the simplest possible approach: hand-written HTML and CSS. No build step. No dependencies. No <code>node_modules</code> folder. Just files that a browser can read.</p>
      <p>There are a few reasons for this choice:</p>

      <blockquote>
        The best technology is the one you don't have to maintain.
      </blockquote>

      <p><strong>Zero maintenance.</strong> There are no packages to update, no breaking changes to fix, no build pipelines to debug. This site will work exactly the same in five years as it does today.</p>
      <p><strong>Instant loading.</strong> Static HTML is the fastest thing on the web. No JavaScript bundle to download and parse. The browser gets HTML and CSS and renders it immediately.</p>
      <p><strong>Full control.</strong> Every line of this site is something I wrote and understand. There's no magic, no abstraction layer, no framework opinions to work around.</p>

      <h2>How to add a new blog post</h2>
      <p>Adding a new post is simple:</p>
      <pre><code>1. Copy an existing post HTML file
2. Update the title, date, and content
3. Add a link to it in blog.html
4. Deploy</code></pre>
      <p>That's it. No CLI commands, no content management system, no Markdown compilation step. Just HTML.</p>

      <h2>Where it's hosted</h2>
      <p>This site is hosted for free on GitHub Pages (though Netlify or Vercel would work just as well). The total cost of running this website is $0 per month. If I add a custom domain, that's about $12 per year.</p>

      <h2>What's next</h2>
      <p>I'll be writing here regularly about what I'm building, what I'm learning, and random things I find interesting. If you want to follow along, bookmark this page or connect with me on your platform of choice.</p>
      <p>Thanks for reading. Here's to keeping things simple.</p>
